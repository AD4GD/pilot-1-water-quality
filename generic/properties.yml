  NO3-N-nitrate-nitrogen:
    label: NO3-N (Nitrate Nitrogen)
    description: Nitrate nitrogen is the final product of nitrification in the nitrogen cycle. Thus, the amount of nitrate nitrogen can indicate the degree of pollution of the water. When there is too much nitrate nitrogen existing in the rivers, lakes or reservoirs, it could cause mass reproduction of algae and lead to eutrophication of water bodies.

  NO2-N-nitrite-nitrogen:
    label: NO2-N (Nitrite Nitrogen)
    description: Most nitrogenous materials in natural waters tend to be converted to nitrate, so all sources of combined nitrogen, particularly organic nitrogen and ammonia, should be considered as potential nitrate sources. Primary sources of organic nitrates include human sewage and livestock manure, especially from feedlots. The primary inorganic nitrates which may contaminate drinking water are potassium nitrate and ammonium nitrate both of which are widely used as fertilizers. [Water Quality Association]

  NH4-ammonia-nitrogen:
    label: NH4 (Ammonia Nitrogen)
    description: Organic nitrogenous compounds are mainly from the decomposition of feces and animal and plant remains. In the decomposition process, amino acids are formed first and then ammonia nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen form in sequence. Thus, if ammonia nitrogen exists in a body of water, it indicates the water has not been polluted for long. [Environmental Water Quality Information]

  Cl-chloride:
    label: Cl- (Chloride)
    description: The chloride ion /ˈklɔːraɪd/ is the anion (negatively charged ion) Cl−. It is formed when the element chlorine (a halogen) gains an electron or when a compound such as hydrogen chloride is dissolved in water or other polar solvents. Chloride salts such as sodium chloride are often very soluble in water. It is an essential electrolyte located in all body fluids responsible for maintaining acid/base balance, transmitting nerve impulses and regulating liquid flow in and out of cells. Less frequently, the word chloride may also form part of the "common" name of chemical compounds in which one or more chlorine atoms are covalently bonded. For example, methyl chloride, with the standard name chloromethane (see IUPAC books) is an organic compound with a covalent C−Cl bond in which the chlorine is not an anion. [DBPedia]

  H4O4Si-silicic-acid:
    label: H4O4Si (Silicic Acid)
    description: In chemistry, a silicic acid (/sɪˈlɪsɪk/) is any chemical compound containing the element silicon attached to oxide (=O) and hydroxyl (−OH) groups, with the general formula [H2xSiOx+2]n or, equivalently, [SiOx(OH)4-2x]n. Orthosilicic acid is a representative example. Silicic acids are rarely observed in isolation, but are thought to exist in aqueous solutions, including seawater, and play a role in biomineralization. They are typically colorless weak acids that are sparingly soluble in water. Like the silicate anions, which are their better known conjugate bases, silicic acids are proposed to be oligomeric or polymeric. No simple silicic acid has ever been identified, since these species being primarily of theoretical interest. [DBPedia]

  TNb-total-bound-nitrogen:
    label: TNb (Total Bound Nitrogen)
    description: Total bound nitrogen (ST-TNb) includes all inorganic forms, nitric nitrogen, nitrous nitrogen, ammoniacal nitrogen and all organic forms of nitrogen in a water sample. Nitrate in particular is one of the fundamental nutrients of algae which, in the presence of sufficient quantities of phosphates and other favourable conditions, determine the eutrophication of water. The main sources of nitrogen are both natural and anthropogenic. Of the anthropogenic sources, particular importance can be attributed to domestic wastewater and the use of fertilizers in agriculture. Reduction of nitrogen load is carried out in domestic and industrial wastewater treatment plants through special denitrification processes. The presence of significant concentrations of nitrogenous substances in water can indicate pollution and pose a risk to health and environment. [ISO]

  specific-conductivity:
    label: Specific Conductivity
    description: Conductivity or specific conductance of an electrolyte solution is a measure of its ability to conduct electricity. The SI unit of conductivity is siemens per meter (S/m). Conductivity measurements are used routinely in many industrial and environmental applications as a fast, inexpensive and reliable way of measuring the ionic content in a solution. For example, the measurement of product conductivity is a typical way to monitor and continuously trend the performance of water purification systems. In many cases, conductivity is linked directly to the total dissolved solids (TDS). [Wikipedia]

    label: Total Suspended Solids
    description: Total suspended solids (TSS) is the dry-weight of suspended particles, that are not dissolved, in a sample of water that can be trapped by a filter that is analyzed using a filtration apparatus known as sintered glass crucible. TSS is a water quality parameter used to assess the quality of a specimen of any type of water or water body, ocean water for example, or wastewater after treatment in a wastewater treatment plant. It is listed as a conventional pollutant in the U.S. Clean Water Act. Total dissolved solids is another parameter acquired through a separate analysis which is also used to determine water quality based on the total substances that are fully dissolved within the water, rather than undissolved suspended particles.

  ORP-oxidation-reduction-potential:
    label: ORP (Oxidation-Reduction Potential)
    description: Redox potential (also known as oxidation / reduction potential, ORP, pe, , or ) is a measure of the tendency of a chemical species to acquire electrons from or lose electrons to an electrode and thereby be reduced or oxidised respectively. Redox potential is expressed in volts (V). Each species has its own intrinsic redox potential; for example, the more positive the reduction potential (reduction potential is more often used due to general formalism in electrochemistry), the greater the species' affinity for electrons and tendency to be reduced.

  carbonate-hardness:
    label: Carbonate Hardness
    description: Carbonate hardness, is a measure of the water hardness caused by the presence of carbonate (CO2−3) and bicarbonate (HCO−3) anions. Carbonate hardness is usually expressed either in degrees KH (dKH) (from the German "Karbonathärte"), or in parts per million calcium carbonate ( ppm CaCO3 or grams CaCO3 per litre|mg/L). One dKH is equal to 17.848 mg/L (ppm) CaCO3, e.g. one dKH corresponds to the carbonate and bicarbonate ions found in a solution of approximately 17.848 milligrams of calcium carbonate(CaCO3) per litre of water (17.848 ppm). Both measurements (mg/L or KH) are usually expressed as mg/L CaCO3 – meaning the concentration of carbonate expressed as if calcium carbonate were the sole source of carbonate ions. [DBPedia]

  COD-chemical-oxygen-demand:
    label: COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand)
    description: In environmental chemistry, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) is an indicative measure of the amount of oxygen that can be consumed by reactions in a measured solution. It is commonly expressed in mass of oxygen consumed over volume of solution which in SI units is milligrams per litre (mg/L). A COD test can be used to easily quantify the amount of organics in water. The most common application of COD is in quantifying the amount of oxidizable pollutants found in surface water (e.g. lakes and rivers) or wastewater. COD is useful in terms of water quality by providing a metric to determine the effect an effluent will have on the receiving body, much like biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). [DBPedia]

  DOC-dissolved-organic-carbon:
    label: DOC (Dissolved Organic Carbon)
    description: Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the fraction of organic carbon operationally defined as that which can pass through a filter with a pore size typically between 0.22 and 0.7 micrometers. The fraction remaining on the filter is called particulate organic carbon (POC). The marine DOC pool is important for the functioning of marine ecosystems because they are at the interface between the chemical and the biological worlds. DOC fuels marine food webs, and is a major component of the Earth's carbon cycling. [DBPedia]
